  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I am an engineering student with a strong interest in gaming and
    frontend web development. Gaming for me is not just entertainment,
    but a space where precision, focus, and performance matter.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nexus Gaming is my concept of a gaming gadgets business where gamers
    can find reliable and high-quality accessories such as mechanical
    keyboards, gaming mice, controllers, and ergonomic gaming chairs.
  </p>

  <p>
    This website reflects my passion for technology, design, and the
    gaming community, combining creativity with a clean and modern
    user experience.
